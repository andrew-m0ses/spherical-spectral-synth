spherical enclosure for Raspberry Pi Pure Data 16-voice polyphonic FFT synthesizer of real-time audio input with 30 variable analog controls for output (pots, toggles, and buttons)--including for spectral sensitivity, randomized dynamical envelopes of synthesized inharmonics, arpeggiation, and note on/off, among other things. 

Pure Data dependencies: zexy and cyclone libraries

PCB layout for the four-chip MCP3008 circuit coming soon... (an extension of https://github.com/andrew-m0ses/rpi-analog-input-hat)

(chrome electroplating of enclosure next...)
