a spherical enclosure for a Raspberry Pi / Pure Data 16-voice polyphonic FFT synthesizer of real-time audio input with 30 variable analog controls for output (pots, toggles, and buttons)--including dynamically 'swelling' inharmonics, arpeggiation, note on/off, among other things. 

PCB layout for the four-chip MCP3008 coming soon... (an extension of https://github.com/andrew-m0ses/rpi-analog-input-hat)
